So today I want to have my hair cut and I believe the price has gone up a little bit.<br/>
Also, it's too bad we run out of coffee. Maybe I need some more or maybe not as the weather<br/>
is getting hotter.<br/>
Stock is a bitch. Nasdaq, Dow Jones and the S&P fell down like...so did HSI and now I have to suffer<br/>
and take the loss tmr. Just don't like it. If it's not going up tonight, tmr is going to be a disaster.<br/>
I have hundreds of pages to read. Will update tmr and see how it goes.<br/>

So today is 2020/5/2, for easy way of writing. This is going to be the first post on github.<br/>
Thank you Github. Everyone is saying github is easy to setup personal site or page. I admit<br/> 
that, if you know the trick. I got the 404 page like many people out there. If you are not<br/>
a code guy, follow my easy step and it may save you a lot of time. So, you got your username<br/> 
when you signed up with github. Use your username when you create your repository the one<br/> 
which you want to run your site or pages. Wait for a couple of minutes you will be good to<br/>
go. You are welcome.<br/>
