So today is 2020/5/2, for easy way of writing. This is going to be the first post on github.
Thank you Github. Everyone is saying github is easy to setup personal site or page. I admit 
that, if you know the trick. I got the 404 page like many people out there. If you are not
a code guy, follow my easy step and it may save you a lot of time. So, you got your username 
when you signed up with github. Use your username when you create your repository the one 
which you want to run your site or pages. Wait for a couple of minutes you will be good to
go. You are welcome.
