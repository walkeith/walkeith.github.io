So today is 2020/5/2, for easy way of writing. This is going to be the first post on github.<br/>
Thank you Github. Everyone is saying github is easy to setup personal site or page. I admit<br/> 
that, if you know the trick. I got the 404 page like many people out there. If you are not<br/>
a code guy, follow my easy step and it may save you a lot of time. So, you got your username<br/> 
when you signed up with github. Use your username when you create your repository the one<br/> 
which you want to run your site or pages. Wait for a couple of minutes you will be good to<br/>
go. You are welcome.<br/>
